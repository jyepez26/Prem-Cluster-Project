            <p>These players have excellent off-ball positioning, being very skilled at exploiting open spaces and to create space for teammates or for their own runs. They are also versatile, and can slide into false 9 or play from out wide when needed, but typically prefer playing down the middle. Maybe not the most clinical, but certainly have the ability to score when it matters.</p>

    <h2>Player Type 2</h2>
    <h3>Pace, Power, Prowess</h3>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="image">
            <img src="../assets/player_type2.png" alt="player_type1" width="2000px"/>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <p>Players with exceptional pace, unbelievable strength, and strong technical abilities. Not as versatile in position, but still create chances through movement and playmaking. Clinical finishers, who are creative artists when the ball finds them in or around the 18.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    

    <h2>Player Type 3</h2>
    <h3>Creative Conductors</h3>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="image">
            <img src="../assets/player_type3.png" alt="player_type1" width="2500px"/>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <p>These players are primarily wingers who are not only incredibly clinical, but also irreplaceable creators on their teams. With both pace and fearlessness, they are not afraid to take an unexpected shot from far or put a fullback in the blender to put the ball on a red carpet for their teammates to finish. Love to whip the ball into the box as well. Funnily enough, a lot of these players are left-footed.</p>

    <h2>Player Type 4</h2>
    <h3>Dribbling Artists</h3>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="image">
            <img src="../assets/player_type4.png" alt="player_type1" width="2000px"/>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <p>These players are extremely skillful on the ball. They are creative; theyâ€™re not afraid to attack defenders straight on with their artistic dribbling abilities. Defending these players one-on-one is a nightmare and you might end up on a highlight reel.</p>
        </div>

    <h2>Player Type 5</h2>
    <h3>Lethal Link-Ups</h3>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="image">
            <img src="../assets/player_type5.png" alt="player_type1" width="2000px"/>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <p>These players are skilled in playing off of teammates. They can link-up well in tight spaces to create the space for an attack. They are also clinical and skilled at scoring in tight spaces inside the 18. Versatile players like these help build strong team attacks. Maybe not the most important players statistically, but are impactful in ways not represented in the statistics!</p>
